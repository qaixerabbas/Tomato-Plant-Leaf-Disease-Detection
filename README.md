# Tomato-Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Alexnet was used to train the system the plant village dataset (Only 5 classes of tomato plant leaf disease)
In this project I have only used following classes from plant village dataset. because there wasnt much space available in my Google Drive.
1. bacterial_spot 
2. early_bright
3. healthy
4. late_bright
5. target_spot

The final classification layer of the AlexNet was modified to be trained on my dataset. Further information is in the notebook and dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease
